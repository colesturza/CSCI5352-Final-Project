# CSCI5352-Final-Project

In this project we chose to look at different methods of partitioning spatial networks into communities. The two major techniques we examined 
were alternative modularity null models and the infomap algorithm. We then used this information to explore how it could be ablied to creating voting 
districts at the state level. 

## Abstract

Gerrymandering is a tactic that has been used throughout modern history to enforce unfair district boundaries in favor of a political party or affiliation. A method to objectively (or as close to objectively as possible) decide district boundaries has long been sought after, as such a discovery would bring parity to many majoritarian political systems, namely in the United States (both federally and locally). Solutions such as the introduction or popularization of entirely proportional voting systems have been suggested, but we seek a solution that could be implemented to help the current political system seen in the US. Modularity calculations are commonplace in network analysis, but it becomes a bit trickier than usual when dealing with spatial networks, as the connections between nodes are limited by physical constraints. Through exploring techniques to effectively modularize given areas and communities, we propose a possible fairer, more objectively-centered method to draw district boundaries, and remove the unfair control that is placed in the hands of those that stand to benefit from the manipulation of such systems.
